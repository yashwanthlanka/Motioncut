This is the first project where we have to make Price Landing Page Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
# Project Title: "Price-Landing-Page"
## Description
This is a basic price landing page created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The purpose 
of this project is to demonstrate our understanding of how to structure an HTML document
and use CSS for styling. We will also be required to write a short script in JavaScript
to handle user interactions with the webpage.
The web page should include the following features:
1. A heading that displays "Pricing page"
2. Four different pricing plans (Basic, Pro, Premium, Enterprise) each with its own section
3. Select the correct Pricing Plan
4. Change the button color when hovering over
5. Show the alert box when a user selects a plan

## Challenges
1. Designing and implementing an interactive pricing structure with toggles was challenging due to the limited understanding of JavaScript.
2. Implementing a responsive design was also challenging as it required a thorough understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
